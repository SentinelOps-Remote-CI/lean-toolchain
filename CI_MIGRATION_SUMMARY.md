# CI Migration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Heavy Local CI

- **Action**: Renamed `ci.yml` to `build-old.yml`
- **Reason**: Replacing with SentinelOps remote CI for better performance and unified infrastructure

### 2. Created SentinelOps Integration

- **File**: `.github/workflows/formal-verify.yml`
- **Purpose**: Uses SentinelOps remote CI with OSS tier
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced local CI load
  - Unified CI infrastructure across repositories
  - Better resource management

### 3. Added Proof Bot Support

- **File**: `.github/workflows/proof-bot.yml`
- **Purpose**: Provides DSP assistance for formal verification
- **Trigger**: PRs labeled with `needs-proof-boost`
- **Features**:
  - Automated proof assistance
  - Code review for formal correctness
  - Proof strategy suggestions

### 4. Cleaned Up Old Files

- **Removed**: `lean_action_ci.yml` (simple CI file)
- **Kept**: `build-old.yml` (backup of original heavy CI)

## Usage

### For PRs Needing Proof Assistance

1. Label the PR with `needs-proof-boost`
2. The proof bot will automatically activate
3. DSP assistance will be provided for formal verification tasks

### CI Workflow

- All pushes and PRs now use SentinelOps remote CI
- OSS tier provides adequate resources for formal verification
- Reduced local infrastructure requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new CI**: Push a test commit to verify SentinelOps integration
2. **Configure repository settings**: Ensure proper access to SentinelOps
3. **Update documentation**: Reference the new CI system in project docs
4. **Monitor performance**: Track CI performance improvements

## Benefits

- **Unified Infrastructure**: Consistent CI across all repositories
- **Better Performance**: Remote CI reduces local resource usage
- **Proof Assistance**: Automated help for formal verification
- **Scalability**: OSS tier can be upgraded as needed
